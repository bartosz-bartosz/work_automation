I have an excel file with two columns ("Billing Document" and " Customer Name"),
and folder full of PDF documents containing the billing document number in their filenames.
This script compares all these filenames with the excel file and finds the Customer Name
corresponding to the PDF. Then it moves the PDF to a new directory named with the Customer Name.
This code doesn't work without proper files. Sensitive data was changed.
